Repository of compression algorithms.
Each folder within the repository contains the respective compression and decompression algorithm. Along with this, the "Test Data" folder contains the sample data, to test the compression algorithm against.

To download the sample data:
Run 'python3 benchmark/retrieve/retrieve.py'

This will retrieve all of the sample data files ALREADY NOT PRESENT on
your local computer. For extending the sample repo database, please
refer to the 'benchmark/retrieve/README.txt'
